<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Microsoft Engage 2021

This project is a part of Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2022. It was a 4 week program organized by Microsoft India Team. The task was to build a Recommendation system, so i choose to make a movie recommendation system, and we have to take care of the algorithm using in this project. 
Throughout this project, my fellow mentees and I had constant support from the mentor(Mr. Vidhyasagar P) Also, various AMA Sessions, Webinars and Leader talks were organized by Microsoft and Team Ace Hacker during this period.

### Movie Recommender System

A movie recommendation system ,recommends movies of the similar content which you like to see, also give information about casts and user reviews on the movie you searched. Imagine the moment you ended your favorite movie and now you wish to see something similar to it?
